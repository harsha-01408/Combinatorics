LVADER - Luke vs. Darth Vader
#combinatorics

You know one of the most dangerous villain of all time, it's Darth Vader. It's time to stop him and Master Luke is looking forward to fight against him. They both are in an infinite two-dimensional grid. Each cell is denoted by (x, y). Here x denotes the row number and y denotes the column number of that cell. Please have a look on that picture of 5 × 7 grid to understand.

0, 0  0, 1  0, 2  0, 3  0, 4  0, 5  0, 6
1, 0
2, 0
3, 0
4, 0

Luke stays at a cell (x1, y1) and Vader stays at another cell (x2, y2). It is guaranteed that x1 ≤ x2 and y1 ≤ y2. Master Luke needs to reach Vader’s cell. Each time Luke can move one step below horizontally or vertically or diagonally. That means, if his position is (x, y) then he can move to (x+1, y) or (x, y+1) or (x+1, y+1) cell in a single move. Given Luke and Vader’s position you have to determine in how many ways Luke can reach to the Vader’s cell. As the answer can be very large output the solution modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input
Input starts with an integer (T ≤ 50) which denotes the number of test case. Each test case consists four integer x1, y1, x2, y2 (0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 100000 and 0 ≤ y1 ≤ y2 ≤ 100000), the position of Luke and Vader.

Output
For each test case, print the number of ways Luke can reach to the Vader’s cell modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example
Input:
3
1 2 2 3
2 2 3 3
3 4 3 5

Output:
Case 1: 3
Case 2: 3
Case 3: 1

Explanation
In the first case he can move from (1, 2) to (2, 3) in the following 3 ways:
(1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3)
(1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3)
(1, 2) → (2, 3)

Dark Room

You are in a room full of bulbs. The i-th bulb has an integer intensity ai.
If a bulb is ON, it contributes its intensity to the room’s overall intensity by
multiplication: the overall intensity is the product of the intensities of all bulbs that are ON.

A positive intensity brightens the room; a negative intensity darkens it.
You want to sleep, so you are interested in selections of bulbs whose overall intensity is NEGATIVE.

Task
Count how many ON/OFF selections (subsets of bulbs) make the overall intensity negative.
Print the answer modulo 1,000,000,007.

Notes
• A subset is valid if and only if the number of chosen bulbs with negative intensity is odd.
• Any bulb with intensity 0 cannot be included in a valid selection (the product would be 0).

Input Format
• The first line contains an integer N — the number of bulbs.
• The next N integers (separated by spaces or newlines) are the intensities a1, a2, …, aN.

Output Format
• Print a single integer: the number of subsets whose product is negative, modulo 1,000,000,007.

Constraints
• 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
• −100 ≤ ai ≤ 100

Sample Input
3
-1
2
-3

Sample Output
4

Explanation
Valid subsets (product < 0):
{-1}, {-1, 2}, {2, -3}, {-3} → total = 4.
